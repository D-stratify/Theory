This repository contains notebooks which apply the forward Kolmogorov equation derived in *Craske J. et al. 2024* to the following examples:

- (1) ABC flow advection diffusion equation 

- (2) 1D diffusion equation

- (3) Lorenz equations

Examples (1) and (2) which can opened and run in a browser using [Google Colab](https://colab.google/). We acknowledge the open source pseudo-spectral code [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.org/) (*Burns K.J. et. al. 2020*) which have used to solve the underlying equations in examples (1) and (2).
