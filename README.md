# PDF_Equation

This repository contains notebooks which apply the forward Kolmogorov equation derived in *Craske J. et al. 2024* to the following examples

Example (1) ABC flow advection diffusion equation 

Example (2) 1D diffusion equation

Example (3) Lorenz equations

In examples (1) and (2) we acknowledge the open source pseudo-spectral code [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.org/) (*Burns K.J. et. al. 2020*) which have used to solve the underlying equations.
